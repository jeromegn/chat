### Lunatic.chat

A telnet chat server written in Rust, running on [Lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic).

I wrote a blog post about the implementation,
[you can read it here](https://lunatic.solutions/blog/lunatic-chat/).

If you just would like to try it out, join the hosted version with:

```bash
# US server
telnet lunatic.chat
# EU server
telnet eu.lunatic.chat
```

You should pick the one closer to you as all the rendering is done on the backend and lower latency
will mean better UX.

### Architecture

The server is written in Rust. The Rust code is then compiled to WebAssembly and runs on top of
Lunatic. Each connection runs in a separate (lightweight) process, has it's own state and sends
just a diff of esc-sequences back to the terminal to bring it up to date with the current render
buffer.

### Build & run instructions

If you have [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) installed:

```bash
# Add Rust nightly:
> rustup toolchain add nightly
# Add the wasm32-wasi target
> rustup target add wasm32-wasi --toolchain nightly
# Build the project
> cargo +nightly build
```

To run it, you will need to have [lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic) on your PATH.
If this is the case you can just run `cargo +nightly run` or find the generated `telnet-chat.wasm` file
in the target folder and run it with `lunatic path/to/telnet-chat.wasm`.
